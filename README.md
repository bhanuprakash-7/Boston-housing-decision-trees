Decision trees are generally used for classification problems. But it can also be used for regression problems by grouping the dependent variable (continuous) into buckets. DecisionTreeRegressor() from the scikit-learn library helps us to use decision trees for regression problems. The implementation is similar to DecisionTreeClassifier()
